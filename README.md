# 🌿 DendroGaming

**An open-source platform bringing the joy of arcade gaming to everyone, for free.**

Welcome to **DendroGaming** — a community-driven initiative to make high-quality, accessible games available to all, especially those who can't afford expensive platforms or subscriptions.

Here, you don't just *play* games. You create your own **custom character**, watch them come to life inside open-source worlds, and embark on magical adventures — whether you're across town or across the globe.

## ✨ Features

- 🎮 **Cloud Arcade Access**  
  Play open-source games remotely using community-hosted machines — reserve a time slot and start exploring.

- 🧍 **Customizable Player Avatars**  
  Design a character that *feels like you*. Use that avatar across multiple games using the Dendro Layer — a universal character injector for 2D/3D games.

- 🕊️ **Lore & Worldbuilding**  
  Meet **Kiki**, the small guardian bird who watches over Dendro from her nest. Discover peaceful, Ghibli-style visuals and kid-friendly fantasy stories full of hope and play.

- 🌐 **Community-Powered Creation**  
  Anyone can contribute characters, music, accessories, mods, and games to the platform. It's all about building *together*.
